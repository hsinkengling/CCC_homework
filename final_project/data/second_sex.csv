Introduction 



I hesitated a long time before writing a book on woman"
" The subject 
is irritating, especially for women; and it is not new"
" Enough ink has 
flowed over the quarrel about feminism; it is now almost over: let's 
not talk about it anymore"
 Yet it is still being talked about
" And the 
volumes of idiocies churned out over this past century do not seem to 
have clarified the problem"
" Besides, is there a problem? And what is 
it? Are there even women? True, the theory of the eternal feminine 
still has its followers; they whisper, ""Even in Russia, women are still 
very much women""; but other well-informed people — and also at 
times those same ones — lament, ""Woman is losing herself, woman is 
lost"
""" It is hard to know any longer if women still exist, if they will 
always exist, if there should be women at all, what place they hold in 
this world, what place they should hold"
" ""Where are the women?"" 
asked a short-lived magazine recently"
" 1 But first, what is a woman? 
""Tota mulier in utero: she is a womb,"" some say"
" Yet speaking of 
certain women, the experts proclaim, ""They are not women,"" even 
though they have a uterus like the others"
" Everyone agrees there are 
females in the human species; today, as in the past, they make up 
about half of humanity; and yet we are told that ""femininity is in 
jeopardy""; we are urged, ""Be women, stay women, become women"
""" 
So not every female human being is necessarily a woman; she must 
take part in this mysterious and endangered reality known as 
femininity"
" Is femininity secreted by the ovaries? Is it enshrined in a 
Platonic heaven? Is a frilly petticoat enough to bring it down to earth? 
Although some women zealously strive to embody it, the model has 
never been patented"
" It is typically described in vague and shimmering 
terms borrowed from a clairvoyant's vocabulary"
" In Saint Thomas's 
time it was an essence defined with as much certainty as the sedative 
quality of a poppy"
" But conceptualism has lost ground: biological and 
social sciences no longer believe there are immutably determined 
entities that define given characteristics like those of the woman, the 
Jew, or the black; science considers characteristics as secondary 



23 



reactions to a situation"
" If there is no such thing today as femininity, it 
is because there never was"
" Does the word ""woman,"" then, have no 
content? It is what advocates of Enlightenment philosophy, 
rationalism, or nominalism vigorously assert: women are, among 
human beings, merely those who are arbitrarily designated by the 
word ""woman""; American women in particular are inclined to think 
that woman as such no longer exists"
" If some backward individual 
still takes herself for a woman, her friends advise her to undergo 
psychoanalysis to get rid of this obsession"
" Referring to a book — a 
very irritating one at that — Modern Woman: The Lost Sex, Dorothy 
Parker wrote: ""I cannot be fair about books that treat women as 
women"
" My idea is that all of us, men as well as women, whoever we 
are, should be considered as human beings"
""" But nominalism is a 
doctrine that falls a bit short; and it is easy for antifeminists to show 
that women are not men"
" Certainly woman like man is a human being; 
but such an assertion is abstract; the fact is that every concrete human 
being is always uniquely situated"
" To reject the notions of the eternal 
feminine, the black soul, or the Jewish character is not to deny that 
there are today Jews, blacks, or women: this denial is not a liberation 
for those concerned but an inauthentic flight"
" Clearly, no woman can 
claim without bad faith to be situated beyond her sex"
" A few years 
ago, a well-known woman writer refused to have her portrait appear 
in a series of photographs devoted specifically to women writers"
" She 
wanted to be included in the men's category; but to get this privilege, 
she used her husband's influence"
" Women who assert they are men 
still claim masculine consideration and respect"
" I also remember a 
young Trotskyite standing on a platform during a stormy meeting, 
about to come to blows in spite of her obvious fragility"
" She was 
denying her feminine frailty; but it was for the love of a militant man 
she wanted to be equal to"
" The defiant position that American women 
occupy proves they are haunted by the feeling of their own femininity"
" 
And the truth is that anyone can clearly see that humanity is split into 
two categories of individuals with manifestly different clothes, faces, 
bodies, smiles, movements, interests, and occupations; these 
differences are perhaps superficial; perhaps they are destined to 
disappear"
" What is certain is that for the moment they exist in a 
strikingly obvious way"
" 

If the female function is not enough to define woman, and if we 



24 



also reject the explanation of the ""eternal feminine,"" but if we accept, 
even temporarily, that there are women on the earth, we then have to 
ask: What is a woman? 

Merely stating the problem suggests an immediate answer to me"
" It 
is significant that I pose it"
" It would never occur to a man to write a 
book on the singular situation of males in humanity"
" 2 If I want to 
define myself, I first have to say, ""I am a woman""; all other assertions 
will arise from this basic truth"
" A man never begins by positing 
himself as an individual of a certain sex: that he is a man is obvious"
" 
The categories masculine and feminine appear as symmetrical in a 
formal way on town hall records or identification papers"
" The relation 
of the two sexes is not that of two electrical poles: the man represents 
both the positive and the neuter to such an extent that in French 
hommes designates human beings, the particular meaning of the word 
vir being assimilated into the general meaning of the word ""homo"
""" 
Woman is the negative, to such a point that any determination is 
imputed to her as a limitation, without reciprocity"
" I used to get 
annoyed in abstract discussions to hear men tell me: ""You think such 
and such a thing because you're a woman"
""" But I know my only 
defense is to answer, ""I think it because it is true,"" thereby eliminating 
my subjectivity; it was out of the question to answer, ""And you think 
the contrary because you are a man,"" because it is understood that 
being a man is not a particularity; a man is in his right by virtue of 
being man; it is the woman who is in the wrong"
" In fact, just as for the 
ancients there was an absolute vertical that defined the oblique, there 
is an absolute human type that is masculine"
" Woman has ovaries and a 
uterus; such are the particular conditions that lock her in her 
subjectivity; some even say she thinks with her hormones"
" Man 
vainly forgets that his anatomy also includes hormones and testicles"
" 
He grasps his body as a direct and normal link with the world that he 
believes he apprehends in all objectivity, whereas he considers 
woman's body an obstacle, a prison, burdened by everything that 
particularizes it"
" ""The female is female by virtue of a certain lack of 
qualities,"" Aristotle said"
" ""We should regard women's nature as 
suffering from natural defectiveness"
""" And Saint Thomas in his turn 
decreed that woman was an ""incomplete man,"" an ""incidental"" being"
" 
This is what the Genesis story symbolizes, where Eve appears as if 
drawn from Adam's ""supernumerary"" bone, in Bossuet's words"
" 



25 



Humanity is male, and man defines woman, not in herself, but in 
relation to himself; she is not considered an autonomous being"
" 
""Woman, the relative being,"" writes Michelet"
" Thus Monsieur Benda 
declares inLe rapport d 'Uriel (Uriel's Report): ""A man's body has 
meaning by itself, disregarding the body of the woman, whereas the 
woman's body seems devoid of meaning without reference to the 
male"
 Man thinks himself without woman
" Woman does not think 
herself without man"
""" And she is nothing other than what man 
decides; she is thus called ""the sex,"" meaning that the male sees her 
essentially as a sexed being; for him she is sex, so she is it in the 
absolute"
" She is determined and differentiated in relation to man, while 
he is not in relation to her; she is the inessential in front of the 
essential"
 He is the Subject; he is the Absolute
 She is the Other
" 3 

The category of Other is as original as consciousness itself"
" The 
duality between Self and Other can be found in the most primitive 
societies, in the most ancient mythologies; this division did not always 
fall into the category of the division of the sexes, it was not based on 
any empirical given: this comes out in works like Granet's on Chinese 
thought, and Dumezil's on India and Rome"
" In couples such as 
Varuna — Mitra, Uranus — Zeus, Sun — Moon, Day — Night, no 
feminine element is involved at the outset; neither in Good — Evil, 
auspicious and inauspicious, left and right, God and Lucifer; alterity is 
the fundamental category of human thought"
" No group ever defines 
itself as One without immediately setting up the Other opposite itself"
" 
It only takes three travelers brought together by chance in the same 
train compartment for the rest of the travelers to become vaguely 
hostile ""others"
""" Village people view anyone not belonging to the 
village as suspicious ""others"
""" For the native of a country inhabitants 
of other countries are viewed as ""foreigners""; Jews are the ""others"" 
for anti-Semites, blacks for racist Americans, indigenous people for 
colonists, proletarians for the propertied classes"
" After studying the 
diverse forms of primitive society in depth, Levi-Strauss could 
conclude: ""The passage from the state of Nature to the state of Culture 
is defined by man's ability to think biological relations as systems of 
oppositions; duality, alternation, opposition, and symmetry, whether 
occurring in defined or less clear form, are not so much phenomena to 
explain as fundamental and immediate givens of social reality"
""" 4 
These phenomena could not be understood if human reality were 



26 



solely aMitsein based on solidarity and friendship"
" On the contrary, 
they become clear if, following Hegel, a fundamental hostility to any 
other consciousness is found in consciousness itself; the subject 
posits itself only in opposition; it asserts itself as the essential and sets 
up the other as inessential, as the object"
" 

But the other consciousness has an opposing reciprocal claim: 
traveling, a local is shocked to realize that in neighboring countries 
locals view him as a foreigner; between villages, clans, nations, and 
classes there are wars, potlatches, agreements, treaties, and struggles 
that remove the absolute meaning from the idea of the Other and bring 
out its relativity; whether one likes it or not, individuals and groups 
have no choice but to recognize the reciprocity of their relation"
" How 
is it, then, that between the sexes this reciprocity has not been put 
forward, that one of the terms has been asserted as the only essential 
one, denying any relativity in regard to its correlative, defining the 
latter as pure alterity? Why do women not contest male sovereignty? 
No subject posits itself spontaneously and at once as the inessential 
from the outset; it is not the Other who, defining itself as Other, 
defines the One; the Other is posited as Other by the One positing 
itself as One"
" But in order for the Other not to turn into the One, the 
Other has to submit to this foreign point of view"
" Where does this 
submission in woman come from? 

There are other cases where, for a shorter or longer time, one 
category has managed to dominate another absolutely"
" It is often 
numerical inequality that confers this privilege: the majority imposes 
its law on or persecutes the minority"
" But women are not a minority 
like American blacks, or like Jews: there are as many women as men 
on the earth"
" Often, the two opposing groups concerned were once 
independent of each other; either they were not aware of each other in 
the past, or they accepted each other's autonomy; and some historical 
event subordinated the weaker to the stronger: the Jewish Diaspora, 
slavery in America, and the colonial conquests are facts with dates"
" In 
these cases, for the oppressed there was a before: they share a past, a 
tradition, sometimes a religion, or a culture"
" In this sense, the parallel 
Bebel draws between women and the proletariat would be the best 
founded: proletarians are not a numerical minority either, and yet they 
have never formed a separate group"
" However, not one event but a 
whole historical development explains their existence as a class and 



27 



accounts for the distribution of these individuals in this class"
" There 
have not always been proletarians: there have always been women; 
they are women by their physiological structure; as far back as history 
can be traced, they have always been subordinate to men; their 
dependence is not the consequence of an event or a becoming, it did 
not happen"
" Alterity here appears to be an absolute, partly because it 
falls outside the accidental nature of historical fact"
" A situation created 
over time can come undone at another time — blacks in Haiti for one 
are a good example; on the contrary, a natural condition seems to defy 
change"
" In truth, nature is no more an immutable given than is 
historical reality"
" If woman discovers herself as the inessential and 
never turns into the essential, it is because she does not bring about 
this transformation herself"
" Proletarians say ""we"
""" So do blacks"
" 
Positing themselves as subjects, they thus transform the bourgeois or 
whites into ""others"
""" Women — except in certain abstract gatherings 
such as conferences — do not use ""we""; men say ""women,"" and 
women adopt this word to refer to themselves; but they do not posit 
themselves authentically as Subjects"
" The proletarians made the 
revolution in Russia, the blacks in Haiti, the Indo-Chinese are fighting 
in Indochina"
" Women's actions have never been more than symbolic 
agitation; they have won only what men have been willing to concede 
to them; they have taken nothing; they have received"
" 5 It is that they 
lack the concrete means to organize themselves into a unit that could 
posit itself in opposition"
" They have no past, no history, no religion of 
their own; and unlike the proletariat, they have no solidarity of labor 
or interests; they even lack their own space that makes communities of 
American blacks, the Jews in ghettos, or the workers in Saint-Denis 
or Renault factories"
" They live dispersed among men, tied by homes, 
work, economic interests, and social conditions to certain men — 
fathers or husbands — more closely than to other women"
" As 
bourgeois women, they are in solidarity with bourgeois men and not 
with women proletarians; as white women, they are in solidarity with 
white men and not with black women"
" The proletariat could plan to 
massacre the whole ruling class; a fanatic Jew or black could dream of 
seizing the secret of the atomic bomb and turning all of humanity 
entirely Jewish or entirely black: but a woman could not even dream 
of exterminating males"
" The tie that binds her to her oppressors is 
unlike any other"
" The division of the sexes is a biological given, not a 



28 



moment in human history"
" Their opposition took shape within an 
original Mitsein, and she has not broken it"
" The couple is a 
fundamental unit with the two halves riveted to each other: cleavage of 
society by sex is not possible"
" This is the fundamental characteristic of 
woman: she is the Other at the heart of a whole whose two 
components are necessary to each other"
" 

One might think that this reciprocity would have facilitated her 
liberation; when Hercules spins wool at Omphale's feet, his desire 
enchains him"
" Why was Omphale unable to acquire long-lasting 
power? Medea, in revenge against Jason, kills her children: this brutal 
legend suggests that the bond attaching the woman to her child could 
have given her a formidable upper hand"
" In Lysistrata, Aristophanes 
lightheartedly imagined a group of women who, uniting together for 
the social good, tried to take advantage of men's need for them: but it 
is only a comedy"
" The legend that claims that the ravished Sabine 
women resisted their ravishers with obstinate sterility also recounts 
that by whipping them with leather straps, the men magically won 
them over into submission"
" Biological need — sexual desire and desire 
for posterity — which makes the male dependent on the female, has not 
liberated women socially"
" Master and slave are also linked by a 
reciprocal economic need that does not free the slave"
" That is, in the 
master-slave relation, the master does not posit the need he has for the 
other; he holds the power to satisfy this need and does not mediate it; 
the slave, on the other hand, out of dependence, hope, or fear, 
internalizes his need for the master; however equally compelling the 
need may be to them both, it always plays in favor of the oppressor 
over the oppressed: this explains the slow pace of working-class 
liberation, for example"
" Now, woman has always been, if not man's 
slave, at least his vassal; the two sexes have never divided the world 
up equally; and still today, even though her condition is changing, 
woman is heavily handicapped"
" In no country is her legal status 
identical to man's, and often it puts her at a considerable disadvantage"
" 
Even when her rights are recognized abstractly, long-standing habit 
keeps them from being concretely manifested in customs"
" 
Economically, men and women almost form two castes; all things 
being equal, the former have better jobs, higher wages, and greater 
chances to succeed than their new female competitors; they occupy 
many more places in industry, in politics, and so forth, and they hold 



29 



the most important positions"
" In addition to their concrete power, they 
are invested with a prestige whose tradition is reinforced by the 
child's whole education: the present incorporates the past, and in the 
past all history was made by males"
" At the moment that women are 
beginning to share in the making of the world, this world still belongs 
to men: men have no doubt about this, and women barely doubt it"
" 
Refusing to be the Other, refusing complicity with man, would mean 
renouncing all the advantages an alliance with the superior caste 
confers on them"
" Lord-man will materially protect liege-woman and 
will be in charge of justifying her existence: along with the economic 
risk, she eludes the metaphysical risk of a freedom that must invent its 
goals without help"
" Indeed, beside every individual's claim to assert 
himself as subject — an ethical claim — lies the temptation to flee 
freedom and to make himself into a thing: it is a pernicious path 
because the individual, passive, alienated, and lost, is prey to a foreign 
will, cut off from his transcendence, robbed of all worth"
" But it is an 
easy path: the anguish and stress of authentically assumed existence 
are thus avoided"
" The man who sets the woman up as an Other will 
thus find in her a deep complicity"
" Hence woman makes no claim for 
herself as subject because she lacks the concrete means, because she 
senses the necessary link connecting her to man without positing its 
reciprocity, and because she often derives satisfaction from her role as 
Other"
" 

But a question immediately arises: How did this whole story begin? 
It is understandable that the duality of the sexes, like all duality, be 
expressed in conflict"
" It is understandable that if one of the two 
succeeded in imposing its superiority, it had to establish itself as 
absolute"
" It remains to be explained how it was that man won at the 
outset"
" It seems possible that women might have carried off the 
victory, or that the battle might never be resolved"
" Why is it that this 
world has always belonged to men and that only today things are 
beginning to change? Is this change a good thing? Will it bring about 
an equal sharing of the world between men and women or not? 

These questions are far from new; they have already had many 
answers; but the very fact that woman is Other challenges all the 
justifications that men have ever given: these were only too clearly 
dictated by their own interest"
" ""Everything that men have written 
about women should be viewed with suspicion, because they are both 



30 



judge and party,"" wrote Poulain de la Barre, a little-known 
seventeenth-century feminist"
" Males have always and everywhere 
paraded their satisfaction of feeling they are kings of creation"
" 
""Blessed be the Lord our God, and the Lord of all worlds that has not 
made me a woman,"" Jews say in their morning prayers; meanwhile, 
their wives resignedly murmur: ""Blessed be the Lord for creating me 
according to his will"
""" Among the blessings Plato thanked the gods 
for was, first, being born free and not a slave and, second, a man and 
not a woman"
" But males could not have enjoyed this privilege so fully 
had they not considered it as founded in the absolute and in eternity: 
they sought to make the fact of their supremacy a right"
" ""Those who 
made and compiled the laws, being men, favored their own sex, and 
the jurisconsults have turned the laws into principles,"" Poulain de la 
Barre continues"
" Lawmakers, priests, philosophers, writers, and 
scholars have gone to great lengths to prove that women's 
subordinate condition was willed in heaven and profitable on earth"
" 
Religions forged by men reflect this will for domination: they found 
ammunition in the legends of Eve and Pandora"
" They have put 
philosophy and theology in their service, as seen in the previously 
cited words of Aristotle and Saint Thomas"
" Since ancient times, 
satirists and moralists have delighted in depicting women's 
weaknesses"
" The violent indictments brought against them all through 
French literature are well-known: Montherlant, with less verve, picks 
up the tradition from Jean de Meung"
" This hostility seems sometimes 
founded but is often gratuitous; in truth, it covers up a more or less 
skillfully camouflaged will to self-justification"
" ""It is much easier to 
accuse one sex than to excuse the other,"" says Montaigne"
" In certain 
cases, the process is transparent"
" It is striking, for example, that the 
Roman code limiting a wife's rights invokes ""the imbecility and 
fragility of the sex"" just when a weakening family structure makes her 
a threat to male heirs"
" It is striking that in the sixteenth century, to 
keep a married woman under wardship, the authority of Saint 
Augustine affirming ""the wife is an animal neither reliable nor stable"" 
is called on, whereas the unmarried woman is recognized as capable 
of managing her own affairs"
" Montaigne well understood the 
arbitrariness and injustice of the lot assigned to women: ""Women are 
not wrong at all when they reject the rules of life that have been 
introduced into the world, inasmuch as it is the men who have made 



31 



these without them"
" There is a natural plotting and scheming between 
them and us"
""" But he does not go so far as to champion their cause"
" It 
is only in the eighteenth century that deeply democratic men begin to 
consider the issue objectively"
" Diderot, for one, tries to prove that, like 
man, woman is a human being"
" A bit later, John Stuart Mill ardently 
defends women"
" But these philosophers are exceptional in their 
impartiality"
" In the nineteenth century the feminist quarrel once again 
becomes a partisan quarrel; one of the consequences of the Industrial 
Revolution is that women enter the labor force: at that point, women's 
demands leave the realm of the theoretical and find economic grounds; 
their adversaries become all the more aggressive; even though landed 
property is partially discredited, the bourgeoisie clings to the old 
values where family solidity guarantees private property: it insists all 
the more fiercely that woman's place be in the home as her 
emancipation becomes a real threat; even within the working class, 
men tried to thwart women's liberation because women were 
becoming dangerous competitors — especially as women were used to 
working for low salaries"
" 6 To prove women's inferiority, 
antifeminists began to draw not only, as before, on religion, 
philosophy, and theology but also on science: biology, experimental 
psychology, and so forth"
" At most they were willing to grant 
""separate but equal status"" to the other sex"
"* That winning formula is 
most significant: it is exactly that formula the Jim Crow laws put into 
practice with regard to black Americans; this so-called egalitarian 
segregation served only to introduce the most extreme forms of 
discrimination"
" This convergence is in no way pure chance: whether it 
is race, caste, class, or sex reduced to an inferior condition, the 
justification process is the same"
" ""The eternal feminine"" corresponds 
to ""the black soul"" or ""the Jewish character"
""" However, the Jewish 
problem on the whole is very different from the two others: for the 
anti-Semite, the Jew is more an enemy than an inferior, and no place 
on this earth is recognized as his own; it would be preferable to see 
him annihilated"
" But there are deep analogies between the situations of 
women and blacks: both are liberated today from the same 
paternalism, and the former master caste wants to keep them ""in their 
place,"" that is, the place chosen for them; in both cases, they praise, 
more or less sincerely, the virtues of the ""good black,"" the carefree, 
childlike, merry soul of the resigned black, and the woman who is a 



32 



""true woman"" — frivolous, infantile, irresponsible, the woman 
subjugated to man"
" In both cases, the ruling caste bases its argument 
on the state of affairs it created itself"
" The familiar line from George 
Bernard Shaw sums it up: The white American relegates the black to 
the rank of shoe-shine boy, and then concludes that blacks are only 
good for shining shoes"
" The same vicious circle can be found in all 
analogous circumstances: when an individual or a group of 
individuals is kept in a situation of inferiority, the fact is that he or 
they are inferior"
" But the scope of the verb to be must be understood; 
bad faith means giving it a substantive value, when in fact it has the 
sense of the Hegelian dynamic: to be is to have become, to have been 
made as one manifests oneself"
" Yes, women in general are today 
inferior to men; that is, their situation provides them with fewer 
possibilities: the question is whether this state of affairs must be 
perpetuated"
" 

Many men wish it would be: not all men have yet laid down their 
arms"
" The conservative bourgeoisie continues to view women's 
liberation as a danger threatening their morality and their interests"
" 
Some men feel threatened by women's competition"
" In Hebdo-Latin 
the other day, a student declared: ""Every woman student who takes a 
position as a doctor or lawyer is stealing a place from us"
""" That 
student never questioned his rights over this world"
" Economic 
interests are not the only ones in play"
" One of the benefits that 
oppression secures for the oppressor is that the humblest among them 
feels superior: in the United States a ""poor white"" from the South can 
console himself for not being a ""dirty nigger""; and more prosperous 
whites cleverly exploit this pride"
" Likewise, the most mediocre of 
males believes himself a demigod next to women"
 It was easier for M
" 
de Montherlant to think himself a hero in front of women 
(handpicked, by the way) than to act the man among men, a role that 
many women assumed better than he did"
" Thus, in one of his articles 
inLe Figaro Litteraire in September 1948, M"
" Claude Mauriac — 
whom everyone admires for his powerful originality — could 7 write 
about women: ""We listen in a tone [sic!] of polite indifference "
""
""
" to 
the most brilliant one among them, knowing that her intelligence, in a 
more or less dazzling way, reflects ideas that come from us"
""" Clearly 
his female interlocutor does not reflect M"
" Mauriac's own ideas, since 
he is known not to have any; that she reflects ideas originating with 



33 



men is possible: among males themselves, more than one of them 
takes as his own opinions he did not invent; one might wonder if it 
would not be in M"
" Claude Mauriac's interest to converse with a good 
reflection of Descartes, Marx, or Gide rather than with himself; what 
is remarkable is that with the ambiguous ""we,"" he identifies with Saint 
Paul, Hegel, Lenin, and Nietzsche, and from their heights he looks 
down on the herd of women who dare to speak to him on an equal 
footing; frankly, I know of more than one woman who would not put 
up with M"
" Mauriac's ""tone of polite indifference"
""" 

I have stressed this example because of its disarming masculine 
naivete"
" Men profit in many other more subtle ways from woman's 
alterity"
" For all those suffering from an inferiority complex, this is a 
miraculous liniment; no one is more arrogant toward women, more 
aggressive or more disdainful, than a man anxious about his own 
virility"
" Those who are not threatened by their fellow men are far more 
likely to recognize woman as a counterpart; but even for them the 
myth of the Woman, of the Other, remains precious for many 
reasons; 8 they can hardly be blamed for not wanting to lightheartedly 
sacrifice all the benefits they derive from the myth: they know what 
they lose by relinquishing the woman of their dreams, but they do not 
know what the woman of tomorrow will bring them"
" It takes great 
abnegation to refuse to posit oneself as unique and absolute Subject"
" 
Besides, the vast majority of men do not explicitly make this position 
their own"
" They do not posit woman as inferior: they are too imbued 
today with the democratic ideal not to recognize all human beings as 
equals"
" Within the family, the male child and then the young man sees 
the woman as having the same social dignity as the adult male; 
afterward, he experiences in desire and love the resistance and 
independence of the desired and loved woman; married, he respects in 
his wife the spouse and the mother, and in the concrete experience of 
married life she affirms herself opposite him as a freedom"
" He can 
thus convince himself that there is no longer a social hierarchy 
between the sexes and that on the whole, in spite of their differences, 
woman is an equal"
" As he nevertheless recognizes some points of 
inferiority — professional incapacity being the predominant one — he 
attributes them to nature"
" When he has an attitude of benevolence and 
partnership toward a woman, he applies the principle of abstract 
equality; and he does not posit the concrete inequality he recognizes"
"

But as soon as he clashes with her, the situation is reversed"
" He will 
apply the concrete inequality theme and will even allow himself to 
disavow abstract equality"
" 9 This is how many men affirm, with quasi 
good faith, that women are equal to men and have no demands to 
make, and at the same time that women will never be equal to men 
and that their demands are in vain"
" It is difficult for men to measure 
the enormous extent of social discrimination that seems insignificant 
from the outside and whose moral and intellectual repercussions are 
so deep in woman that they appear to spring from an original 
nature"
" 10 The man most sympathetic to women never knows her 
concrete situation fully"
" So there is no good reason to believe men 
when they try to defend privileges whose scope they cannot even 
fathom"
" We will not let ourselves be intimidated by the number and 
violence of attacks against women; nor be fooled by the self-serving 
praise showered on the ""real woman""; nor be won over by men's 
enthusiasm for her destiny, a destiny they would not for the world 
want to share"
" 

We must not, however, be any less mistrustful of feminists' 
arguments: very often their attempt to polemicize robs them of all 
value"
" If the ""question of women"" is so trivial, it is because masculine 
arrogance turned it into a ""quarrel""; when people quarrel, they no 
longer reason well"
" What people have endlessly sought to prove is 
that woman is superior, inferior, or equal to man: created after Adam, 
she is obviously a secondary being, some say; on the contrary, say 
others, Adam was only a rough draft, and God perfected the human 
being when he created Eve; her brain is smaller, but relatively bigger; 
Christ was made man, but perhaps out of humility"
" Every argument 
has its opposite, and both are often misleading"
" To see clearly, one 
needs to get out of these ruts; these vague notions of superiority, 
inferiority, and equality that have distorted all discussions must be 
discarded in order to start anew"
" 

But how, then, will we ask the question? And in the first place, 
who are we to ask it? Men are judge and party: so are women"
" Can an 
angel be found? In fact, an angel would be ill qualified to speak, 
would not understand all the givens of the problem; as for the 
hermaphrodite, it is a case of its own: it is not both a man and a 
woman, but neither man nor woman"
" I think certain women are still 
best suited to elucidate the situation of women"
" It is a sophism to

claim that Epimenides should be enclosed within the concept of 
Cretan and all Cretans within the concept of liar: it is not a mysterious 
essence that dictates good or bad faith to men and women; it is their 
situation that disposes them to seek the truth to a greater or lesser 
extent"
" Many women today, fortunate to have had all the privileges of 
the human being restored to them, can afford the luxury of 
impartiality: we even feel the necessity of it"
" We are no longer like our 
militant predecessors; we have more or less won the game; in the 
latest discussions on women's status, the UN has not ceased to 
imperiously demand equality of the sexes, and indeed many of us 
have never felt our femaleness to be a difficulty or an obstacle; many 
other problems seem more essential than those that concern us 
uniquely: this very detachment makes it possible to hope our attitude 
will be objective"
" Yet we know the feminine world more intimately 
than men do because our roots are in it; we grasp more immediately 
what the fact of being female means for a human being, and we care 
more about knowing it"
" I said that there are more essential problems; 
but this one still has a certain importance from our point of view: 
How will the fact of being women have affected our lives? What 
precise opportunities have been given us, and which ones have been 
denied? What destiny awaits our younger sisters, and in which 
direction should we point them? It is striking that most feminine 
literature is driven today by an attempt at lucidity more than by a will 
to make demands; coming out of an era of muddled controversy, this 
book is one attempt among others to take stock of the current state"
" 

But it is no doubt impossible to approach any human problem 
without partiality: even the way of asking the questions, of adopting 
perspectives, presupposes hierarchies of interests; all characteristics 
comprise values; every so-called objective description is set against an 
ethical background"
" Instead of trying to conceal those principles that 
are more or less explicitly implied, we would be better off stating 
them from the start; then it would not be necessary to specify on each 
page the meaning given to the words ""superior,"" ""inferior,"" ""better,"" 
""worse,"" ""progress,"" ""regression,"" and so on"
" If we examine some of 
the books on women, we see that one of the most frequently held 
points of view is that of public good or general interest: in reality, this 
is taken to mean the interest of society as each one wishes to maintain 
or establish it"
" In our opinion, there is no public good other than one

that assures the citizens' private good; we judge institutions from the 
point of view of the concrete opportunities they give to individuals"
" 
But neither do we confuse the idea of private interest with happiness: 
that is another frequently encountered point of view; are women in a 
harem not happier than a woman voter? Is a housewife not happier 
than a woman worker? We cannot really know what the word 
""happiness"" means, and still less what authentic values it covers; there 
is no way to measure the happiness of others, and it is always easy to 
call a situation that one would like to impose on others happy: in 
particular, we declare happy those condemned to stagnation, under the 
pretext that happiness is immobility"
" This is a notion, then, we will not 
refer to"
" The perspective we have adopted is one of existentialist 
morality"
" Every subject posits itself as a transcendence concretely, 
through projects; it accomplishes its freedom only by perpetual 
surpassing toward other freedoms; there is no other justification for 
present existence than its expansion toward an indefinitely open 
future"
" Every time transcendence lapses into immanence, there is 
degradation of existence into ""in-itself,"" of freedom into facticity; this 
fall is a moral fault if the subject consents to it; if this fall is inflicted 
on the subject, it takes the form of frustration and oppression; in both 
cases it is an absolute evil"
" Every individual concerned with justifying 
his existence experiences his existence as an indefinite need to 
transcend himself"
" But what singularly defines the situation of woman 
is that being, like all humans, an autonomous freedom, she discovers 
and chooses herself in a world where men force her to assume herself 
as Other: an attempt is made to freeze her as an object and doom her 
to immanence, since her transcendence will be forever transcended by 
another essential and sovereign consciousness"
" Woman's drama lies 
in this conflict between the fundamental claim of every subject, which 
always posits itself as essential, and the demands of a situation that 
constitutes her as inessential"
" How, in the feminine condition, can a 
human being accomplish herself? What paths are open to her? Which 
ones lead to dead ends? How can she find independence within 
dependence? What circumstances limit women's freedom and can she 
overcome them? These are the fundamental questions we would like 
to elucidate"
" This means that in focusing on the individual's 
possibilities, we will define these possibilities not in terms of 
happiness but in terms of freedom"
"

Clearly this problem would have no meaning if we thought that a 
physiological, psychological, or economic destiny weighed on 
woman"
" So we will begin by discussing woman from a biological, 
psychoanalytical, and historical materialist point of view"
" We will then 
attempt to positively demonstrate how ""feminine reality"" has been 
constituted, why woman has been defined as Other, and what the 
consequences have been from men's point of view"
" Then we will 
describe the world from the woman's point of view such as it is 
offered to her, 1 1 and we will see the difficulties women are up against 
just when, trying to escape the sphere they have been assigned until 
now, they seek to be part of the human Mitsein"

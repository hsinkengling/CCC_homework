There is no gender identity behind the expressions of gender...identity is performatively constituted by the very expressions that are said to be its results.
To operate within the matrix of power is not the same as to replicate uncritically relations of domination.
"Gender is not an identity tenuously constituted in time, instituted in an exterior space through a stylized repetition of facts."
Masculine and feminine roles are not biologically fixed but socially constructed.
The violence of language consists in its effort to capture the ineffable and hence to destroy it to seize hold of that which must remain elusive for language to operate as a living thing.
"Critical does not mean destructive, but only willing to examine what we sometimes presuppose in our way of thinking, and that gets in the way of making a more livable world."
"Love is not a state, a feeling, a disposition but an exchange, uneven, fraught with history, with ghosts, wit hlongings that are more or less legible to those who try to see one another with their own faulty vision."

Teaching gender is not indoctrination: it does not tell a person how to live; it opens up the possibility for young people to find their own way in a world that often confronts them with narrow and cruel social norms. To affirm gender diversity is therefore not destructive: it affirms human complexity and creates a space for people to find their own way within this complexity.
"The violence of language consists in its effort to capture the ineffable and hence, to destroy it, to seize hold of that which must remain elusive for language to operate as a living thing."
